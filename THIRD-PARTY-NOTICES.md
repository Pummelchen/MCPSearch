# Third-party notices

MCPSearch is MIT-licensed — see [LICENSE](LICENSE). It is built from the packages pinned in
[`Package.resolved`](Package.resolved) and ships their code inside any distributed binary, so
their licence terms travel with it.

Two dependencies — `swift-nio` and `swift-log` — are Apache-2.0 **without** the Swift Runtime
Library Exception, so Apache-2.0 §4(d) requires a distributed work to reproduce their
`NOTICE.txt`, and both are reproduced verbatim below. Three others carry that Exception, which
waives the §4(a)/(b)/(d) attribution requirement for code embedded into a compiled binary; their
notices are not reproduced because the Exception says they need not be, and that is stated here
rather than left as an unexplained omission. The Apache-2.0 and MIT licence texts are reproduced
in full, as §4(a) requires a copy of the License to accompany the work.

`scripts/third_party_notices.py` fails CI when this inventory stops matching
`Package.resolved`, in either direction. It deliberately does not generate this file: each
licence is read and recorded deliberately, so that an unlicensed or copyleft dependency cannot
be pulled in unremarked by a routine `swift package update`.

<!-- inventory:start -->
| Package | Version | Licence | Runtime Library Exception | Upstream notice |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `eventsource` | 1.5.1 | MIT | n/a | — |
| `swift-atomics` | 1.3.1 | Apache-2.0 | **yes** — §4(a)/(b)/(d) waived | not required |
| `swift-collections` | 1.6.0 | Apache-2.0 | **yes** — §4(a)/(b)/(d) waived | not required |
| `swift-log` | 1.15.1 | Apache-2.0 | no | [reproduced below](#swiftlog-notice) |
| `swift-nio` | 2.102.0 | Apache-2.0 | no | [reproduced below](#swiftnio-notice) |
| `swift-sdk` | 0.12.1 | MIT and Apache-2.0, mixed | n/a — see [notes](#licence-notes) | — |
| `swift-system` | 1.8.1 | Apache-2.0 | **yes** — §4(a)/(b)/(d) waived | not required |
| `SwiftSoup` | 2.13.5 | MIT | n/a | — |
<!-- inventory:end -->

Three of the eight are direct dependencies (`swift-sdk`, `SwiftSoup`, `swift-nio`); the other five
arrive transitively. Identities are SwiftPM's; versions are the ones `Package.resolved` pins.

## Licence notes

* **The Runtime Library Exception.** `swift-atomics`, `swift-collections` and `swift-system` ship
  the Apache-2.0 text with an appended exception reading:

  > As an exception, if you use this Software to compile your source code and portions of this
  > Software are embedded into the binary product as a result, you may redistribute such product
  > without providing attribution as would otherwise be required by Sections 4(a), 4(b) and 4(d)
  > of the License.

  That is the Swift project's standard runtime-library exception, and its effect here is that
  those three packages need no notice in a distributed MCPSearch binary. It does not relax
  §4(c)'s retained-notice requirement for **source** redistribution, which is why the full
  Apache-2.0 text is carried below. The same three packages also omit the Apache-2.0 `APPENDIX`
  ("how to apply the License") boilerplate; that section is instructional and not a licence term,
  and the canonical text including it is the one reproduced here.

* **`swift-sdk`** (the Model Context Protocol Swift SDK) is mid-transition from MIT to
  Apache-2.0. Its `LICENSE` states that contributions relicensed with consent are Apache-2.0,
  that contributions from authors who licensed under MIT and have not consented remain MIT, and
  the documentation outside the specifications is CC-BY-4.0. It ships **no** `NOTICE.txt`, so
  there is nothing to reproduce; this repository treats it as MIT *and* Apache-2.0 mixed and
  carries both licence texts rather than asserting one. The CC-BY-4.0 grant covers upstream
  prose, not code compiled into a binary here.

* **`swift-nio`**'s `NOTICE.txt` points at further per-component terms (`LICENSE.<component>.txt`)
  for Netty, llhttp, uSHET, FreeBSD `sha1`, and derivations from swift-extras-base64,
  AsyncHTTPClient, SwiftCertificates, Swift System and Swift Package Manager. Those components are
  part of the SwiftNIO distribution this project links; their notices and component references are
  reproduced in the SwiftNIO notice below, and their terms resolve to the Apache-2.0 and MIT texts
  carried here.

* No dependency imposes a copyleft or source-disclosure obligation on MCPSearch's own code.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
      identification within third-party archives.
